UK and its overseas territories, promoting the UK's global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. They are active and regular participants in NATO, including the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, as well as the Five Power Defence Arrangements, RIMPAC and other worldwide coalition operations. Overseas garrisons and facilities are maintained in Ascension Island, Bahrain, Belize, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Diego Garcia, the Falkland Islands, Germany, Gibraltar, Kenya, Oman, Qatar and Singapore.[250][251]

The British armed forces played a key role in establishing the British Empire as the dominant world power in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. By emerging victorious from conflicts, Britain has often been able to decisively influence world events. Since the end of the British Empire, the UK has remained a major military power. Following the end of the Cold War, defence policy has a stated assumption that "the most demanding operations" will be undertaken as part of a coalition.[252]

According to sources which include the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the UK has either the fourth- or the fifth-highest military expenditure. Total defence spending amounts to 2.0 per cent of national GDP.[253]
Economy
Main article: Economy of the United Kingdom
Overview
The Bank of England – the central bank of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based

The UK has a partially regulated market economy.[254] Based on market exchange rates, the UK is today the fifth-largest economy in the world and the second-largest in Europe after Germany. HM Treasury, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy. The Bank of England is the UK's central bank and is responsible for issuing notes and coins in the nation's currency, the pound sterling. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover their issue. The pound sterling is the world's third-largest reserve currency (after the US dollar and the euro).[255] Since 1997 the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, headed by the Governor of the Bank of England, has been responsible for setting interest rates at the level necessary to achieve the overall inflation target for the economy that is set by the Chancellor each year.[256]

The UK service sector makes up around 79 per cent of GDP.[257] London is one of the world's largest financial centres, ranking 2nd in the world, behind New York City, in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2020.[258] London also has the largest city GDP in Europe.[259] Edinburgh ranks 17th in the world, and 6th in Western Europe in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2020.[258] Tourism is very important to the British economy; with over 27 million tourists arriving in 2004, the United Kingdom is ranked as the sixth major tourist destination in the world and London has the most international visitors of any city in the world.[260][261] The creative industries accounted for 7 per cent GVA in 2005 and grew at an average of 6 per cent per annum between 1997 and 2005.[262]

Following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, the functioning of the UK internal economic market is enshrined by the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020 which ensures trade in goods and services continues without internal barriers across the four countries of the United Kingdom.[263][264]

The Industrial Revolution started in the UK with an initial concentration on the textile industry,[265] followed by other heavy industries such as shipbuilding, coal mining and steelmaking.[266][267] British merchants, shippers and bankers developed overwhelming advantage over those of other nations allowing the UK to dominate international trade in the 19th century.[268][269] As other nations industrialised, coupled with economic decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century. Manufacturing remains a significant part of the economy but accounted for only 16.7 per cent of national output in 2003.[270]

The automotive industry employs around 800,000 people, with a turnover in 2015 of £70 billion, generating £34.6 billion of exports (11.8 per cent of the UK's total export goods). In 2015, the UK produced around 1.6 million passenger vehicles and 94,500 commercial vehicles. The UK is a major centre for engine manufacturing: in 2015 around 2.4 million engines were produced. The UK motorsport industry employs around 41,000 people, comprises around 4,500 companies and has an annual turnover of around £6 billion.[271]

The aerospace industry of the UK is the second- or third-largest national aerospace industry in the world depending upon the method of measurement and has an annual turnover of around £30 billion.[272]
Engines and wings for the Airbus A380 are manufactured in the UK.

BAE Systems plays a critical role in some of the world's biggest defence aerospace projects. In the UK, the company makes large sections of the Typhoon Eurofighter and assembles the aircraft for the Royal Air Force. It is also a principal subcontractor on the F35 Joint Strike Fighter – the world's largest single defence project – for which it designs and manufactures a range of components. It also manufactures the Hawk, the world's most successful jet training aircraft.[273] Airbus UK also manufactures the wings for the A400 m military transporter. Rolls-Royce is the world's second-largest aero-engine manufacturer. Its engines power more than 30 types of commercial aircraft and it has more than 30,000 engines in service in the civil and defence sectors.

The UK space industry was worth £9.1bn in 2011 and employed 29,000 people. It is growing at a rate of 7.5 per cent annually, according to its umbrella organisation, the UK Space Agency. In 2013, the British Government pledged £60 m to the Skylon project: this investment will provide support at a "crucial stage" to allow a full-scale prototype of the SABRE engine to be built.

The pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in the UK economy and the country has the third-highest share of global pharmaceutical R&D expenditures.[274][275]

Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanised and efficient by European standards, producing about 60 per cent of food needs with less than 1.6 per cent of the labour force (535,000 workers).[276] Around two-thirds of production is devoted to livestock, one-third to arable crops. The UK retains a significant, though much reduced fishing industry. It is also rich in a number of natural resources including coal, petroleum, natural gas, tin, limestone, iron ore, salt, clay, chalk, gypsum, lead, silica and an abundance of arable land.[277]
The City of London is one of two main financial centres[278][279][280]
Canary Wharf is one of two main financial centres of the United Kingdom

In the final quarter of 2008, the UK economy officially entered recession for the first time since 1991.[281] Following the likes of the United States, France and many major economies, in 2013, the UK lost its top AAA credit rating for the first time since 1978 with Moodys and Fitch credit agency, but, unlike the other major economies, retained its triple A rating with Standard & Poor's.[282][283] By the end of 2014, UK growth was the fastest in both the G7 and in Europe,[284][285] and by September 2015, the unemployment rate was down to a seven-year low of 5.3 per cent.[286] In 2020, coronavirus lockdown measures caused the UK economy to suffer its biggest slump on record, shrinking by 20.4 per cent between April and June compared to the first three months of the year, to push it officially into recession for the first time in 11 years.[287]

The UK has an external debt of $9.6 trillion dollars, which is the second-highest in the world after the US. As a percentage of GDP, external debt is 408 per cent, which is the third-highest in the world after Luxembourg and Iceland.[288][289][290][291][292]
Science and technology
Main article: Science and technology in the United Kingdom
Charles Darwin (1809–1882), whose theory of evolution by natural selection is the foundation of modern biological sciences

England and Scotland were leading centres of the Scientific Revolution from the 17th century.[293] The United Kingdom led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century,[265] and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances.[294] Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science;[295] from the 19th century Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and James Clerk Maxwell, who formulated classical electromagnetic theory; and more recently Stephen Hawking, who advanced major theories in the fields of cosmology, quantum gravity and the investigation of black holes.[296]

Major scientific discoveries from the 18th century include hydrogen by Henry Cavendish;[297] from the 20th century penicillin by Alexander Fleming,[298] and the structure of DNA, by Francis Crick and others.[299] Famous British engineers and inventors of the Industrial Revolution include James Watt, George Stephenson, Richard Arkwright, Robert Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel.[300] Other major engineering projects and applications by people from the UK include the steam locomotive, developed by Richard Trevithick and Andrew Vivian;[301] from the 19th century the electric motor by Michael Faraday, the first computer designed by Charles Babbage,[302] the first commercial electrical telegraph by William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone,[303] the incandescent light bulb by Joseph Swan,[304] and the first practical telephone, patented by Alexander Graham Bell;[305] and in the 20th century the world's first working television system by John Logie Baird and others,[306] the jet engine by Frank Whittle, the basis of the modern computer by Alan Turing, and the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee.[307]

Scientific research and development remains important in British universities, with many establishing science parks to facilitate production and co-operation with industry.[308] Between 2004 and 2008 the UK produced 7 per cent of the world's scientific research papers and had an 8 per cent share of scientific citations, the third and second-highest in the world (after the United States and China, respectively).[309] Scientific journals produced in the UK include Nature, the British Medical Journal and The Lancet.[310]
Transport
Main article: Transport in the United Kingdom
London St Pancras International is the UK's 13th busiest railway terminus. The station is one of London's main domestic and international transport hubs providing both commuter rail and high-speed rail services across the UK and to Paris, Lille and Brussels.

A radial road network totals 29,145 miles (46,904 km) of main roads, 2,173 miles (3,497 km) of motorways and 213,750 miles (344,000 km) of paved roads.[152] The M25, encircling London, is the largest and busiest bypass in the world.[311] In 2009 there were a total of 34 million licensed vehicles in Great Britain.[312]

The rail network in the UK is the oldest such network in the world. The system consists of five high-speed main lines (the West Coast, East Coast, Midland, Great Western and Great Eastern), which radiate from London to the rest of the country, augmented by regional rail lines and dense commuter networks within the major cities. High Speed 1 is operationally separate from the rest of the network. The world's first passenger railway running on steam was the Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened on 27 September 1825. Just under five years later the world's first intercity railway was the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, designed by George Stephenson and opened by the Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington on 15 September 1830. The network grew rapidly as a patchwork of literally hundreds of separate companies during the Victorian era.[313][314][315][316][317][318]

The UK has a railway network of 10,072 miles (16,209 km) in Great Britain and 189 miles (304 km) in Northern Ireland. Railways in Northern Ireland are operated by NI Railways, a subsidiary of state-owned Translink. In Great Britain, the British Rail network was privatised between 1994 and 1997, which was followed by a rapid rise in passenger numbers. The UK was ranked eighth among national European rail systems in the 2017 European Railway Performance Index assessing intensity of use, quality of service and safety.[319] Network Rail owns and manages most of the fixed assets (tracks, signals etc.). HS2, a new high-speed railway line, is estimated to cost £56 billion.[320] Crossrail, under construction in London, is Europe's largest construction project with a £15 billion projected cost.[321][322]

In the year from October 2009 to September 2010 UK airports handled a total of 211.4 million passengers.[323] In that period the three largest airports were London Heathrow Airport (65.6 million passengers), Gatwick Airport (31.5 million passengers) and London Stansted Airport (18.9 million passengers).[323] London Heathrow Airport, located 15 miles (24 km) west of the capital, has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the world[324][325] and is the hub for the UK flag carrier British Airways, as well as Virgin Atlantic.[326]
Energy
Main article: Energy in the United Kingdom
Wind turbines overlooking Ardrossan, Scotland. The UK is one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy, and wind power production is its fastest growing supply.

In 2006, the UK was the world's ninth-largest consumer of energy and the 15th-largest producer.[327] The UK is home to a number of large energy companies, including two of the six oil and gas "supermajors" – BP and Royal Dutch Shell.[328][329]

In 2013, the UK produced 914 thousand barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil and consumed 1,507 thousand bbl/d.[330][331] Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of oil since 2005.[332] In 2010 the UK had around 3.1 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves, the largest of any EU member state.[332]

In 2009, the UK was the 13th-largest producer of natural gas in the world and the largest producer in the EU.[333] Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of natural gas since 2004.[333]

Coal production played a key role in the UK economy in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the mid-1970s, 130 million tonnes of coal were produced annually, not falling below 100 million tonnes until the early 1980s. During the 1980s and 1990s the industry was scaled back considerably. In 2011, the UK produced 18.3 million tonnes of coal.[334] In 2005 it had proven recoverable coal reserves of 171 million tons.[334] The UK Coal Authority has stated there is a potential to produce between 7 billion tonnes and 16 billion tonnes of coal through underground coal gasification (UCG) or 'fracking',[335] and that, based on current UK coal consumption, such reserves could last between 200 and 400 years.[336] Environmental and social concerns have been raised over chemicals getting into the water table and minor earthquakes damaging homes.[337][338]

In the late 1990s, nuclear power plants contributed around 25 per cent of total annual electricity generation in the UK, but this has gradually declined as old plants have been shut down and ageing-related problems affect plant availability. In 2012, the UK had 16 reactors normally generating about 19 per cent of its electricity. All but one of the reactors will be retired by 2023. Unlike Germany and Japan, the UK intends to build a new generation of nuclear plants from about 2018.[339]

The total of all renewable electricity sources provided for 38.9 per cent of the electricity generated in the United Kingdom in the third quarter of 2019, producing 28.8TWh of electricity.[340] The UK is one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy, and wind power production is its fastest growing supply, in 2019 it generated almost 20 per cent of the UK's total electricity.[341]
Water supply and sanitation
Main article: Water supply and sanitation in the United Kingdom

Access to improved water supply and sanitation in the UK is universal. It is estimated that 96.7 per cent of households are connected to the sewer network.[342] According to the Environment Agency, total water abstraction for public water supply in the UK was 16,406 megalitres per day in 2007.[343]

In England and Wales water and sewerage services are provided by 10 private regional water and sewerage companies and 13 mostly smaller private "water only" companies. In Scotland water and sewerage services are provided by a single public company, Scottish Water. In Northern Ireland water and sewerage services are also provided by a single public entity, Northern Ireland Water.[344]
Demographics
Main article: Demography of the United Kingdom
Map of population density in the UK as at the 2011 census

A census is taken simultaneously in all parts of the UK every 10 years.[345] In the 2011 census the total population of the United Kingdom was 63,181,775.[346] It is the fourth-largest in Europe (after Russia, Germany and France), the fifth-largest in the Commonwealth and the 22nd-largest in the world. In mid-2014 and mid-2015 net long-term international migration contributed more to population growth. In mid-2012 and mid-2013 natural change contributed the most to population growth.[347] Between 2001 and 2011 the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately 0.7 per cent.[346] This compares to 0.3 per cent per year in the period 1991 to 2001 and 0.2 per cent in the decade 1981 to 1991.[348] The 2011 census also confirmed that the proportion of the population aged 0–14 has nearly halved (31 per cent in 1911 compared to 18 in 2011) and the proportion of older people aged 65 and over has more than tripled (from 5 per cent to 16 per cent).[346]

England's population in 2011 was 53 million.[349] It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with 420 people resident per square kilometre in mid-2015,[347] with a particular concentration in London and the south-east.[350] The 2011 census put Scotland's population at 5.3 million,[351] Wales at 3.06 million and Northern Ireland at 1.81 million.[349]

In 2017 the average total fertility rate (TFR) across the UK was 1.74 children born per woman.[352] While a rising birth rate is contributing to population growth, it remains considerably below the baby boom peak of 2.95 children per woman in 1964,[353] or the high of 6.02 children born per woman in 1815,[354] below the replacement rate of 2.1, but higher than the 2001 record low of 1.63.[355] In 2011, 47.3 per cent of births in the UK were to unmarried women.[356] The Office for National Statistics published a bulletin in 2015 showing that, out of the UK population aged 16 and over, 1.7 per cent identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (2.0 per cent of males and 1.5 per cent of females); 4.5 per cent of respondents responded with "other", "I don't know", or did not respond.[357] In 2018 the median age of the UK population was 41.7 years.[358]

Ethnic groups
Main article: Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom
Percentage of the population not white according to the 2011 census

Historically, indigenous British people were thought to be descended from the various ethnic groups that settled there before the 12th century: the Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the Normans. Welsh people could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK.[362] A 2006 genetic study shows that more than 50 per cent of England's gene pool contains Germanic Y chromosomes.[363] Another 2005 genetic analysis indicates that "about 75 per cent of the traceable ancestors of the modern British population had arrived in the British isles by about 6,200 years ago, at the start of the British Neolithic or Stone Age", and that the British broadly share a common ancestry with the Basque people.[364][365][366]

The UK has a history of non-white immigration with Liverpool having the oldest Black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the African slave trade. During this period it is estimated the Afro-Caribbean population of Great Britain was 10,000 to 15,000[367] which later declined due to the abolition of slavery.[368][369] The UK also has the oldest Chinese community in Europe, dating to the arrival of Chinese seamen in the 19th century.[370] In 1950 there were probably fewer than 20,000 non-white residents in Britain, almost all born overseas.[371] In 1951 there were an estimated 94,500 people living in Britain who had been born in South Asia, China, Africa and the Caribbean, just under 0.2 per cent of the UK population. By 1961 this number had more than quadrupled to 384,000, just over 0.7 per cent of the United Kingdom population.[372]

Since 1948 substantial immigration from Africa, the Caribbean and South Asia has been a legacy of ties forged by the British Empire.[373] Migration from new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe since 2004 has resulted in growth in these population groups, although some of this migration has been temporary.[374] Since the 1990s, there has been substantial diversification of the immigrant population, with migrants to the UK coming from a much wider range of countries than previous waves, which tended to involve larger numbers of migrants coming from a relatively small number of countries.[375][376][377]

Academics have argued that the ethnicity categories employed in British national statistics, which were first introduced in the 1991 census, involve confusion between the concepts of ethnicity and race.[382][383] In 2011, 87.2 per cent of the UK population identified themselves as white, meaning 12.8 per cent of the UK population identify themselves as of one of number of ethnic minority groups.[379] In the 2001 census, this figure was 7.9 per cent of the UK population.[384]

Because of differences in the wording of the census forms used in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, data on the Other White group is not available for the UK as a whole, but in England and Wales this was the fastest growing group between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, increasing by 1.1 million (1.8 percentage points).[385] Amongst groups for which comparable data is available for all parts of the UK level, the Other Asian category increased from 0.4 per cent to 1.4 per cent of the population between 2001 and 2011, while the Mixed category rose from 1.2 per cent to 2 per cent.[379]

Ethnic diversity varies significantly across the UK. 30.4 per cent of London's population and 37.4 per cent of Leicester's was estimated to be non-white in 2005,[386][387] whereas less than 5 per cent of the populations of North East England, Wales and the South West were from ethnic minorities, according to the 2001 census.[388] In 2016, 31.4 per cent of primary and 27.9 per cent of secondary pupils at state schools in England were members of an ethnic minority.[389] The 1991 census was the first UK census to have a question on ethnic group. In the 1991 UK census 94.1 per cent of people reported themselves as being White British, White Irish or White Other with 5.9 per cent of people reporting themselves as coming from other minority groups.[390]
Languages
Main article: Languages of the United Kingdom
The English-speaking world. States and territories in dark blue have a majority of native English or English Creole speakers, while those where English is an official but not a majority language are shaded in light blue. English is one of the main working languages of the European Union[391] and the United Nations.[392]

The UK's de facto official language is English.[393][394] It is estimated that 95 per cent of the UK's population are monolingual English speakers.[395] 5.5 per cent of the population are estimated to speak languages brought to the UK as a result of relatively recent immigration.[395] South Asian languages are the largest grouping which includes Punjabi, Urdu, Bengali/Sylheti, Hindi and Gujarati.[396] According to the 2011 census, Polish has become the second-largest language spoken in England and has 546,000 speakers.[397] In 2019, some three quarters of a million people spoke little or no English.[398]

Three indigenous Celtic languages are spoken in the UK: Welsh, Irish and Scottish Gaelic. Cornish, which became extinct as a first language in the late 18th century, is subject to revival efforts and has a small group of second language speakers.[399][400][2][401] In the 2011 Census, approximately one-fifth (19 per cent) of the population of Wales said they could speak Welsh,[402][403] an increase from the 1991 Census (18 per cent).[404] In addition, it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh speakers live in England.[405] In the same census in Northern Ireland 167,487 people (10.4 per cent) stated that they had "some knowledge of Irish" (see Irish language in Northern Ireland), almost exclusively in the nationalist (mainly Catholic) population. Over 92,000 people in Scotland (just under 2 per cent of the population) had some Gaelic language ability, including 72 per cent of those living in the Outer Hebrides.[406] The number of children being taught either Welsh or Scottish Gaelic is increasing.[407] Among emigrant-descended populations some Scottish Gaelic is still spoken in Canada (principally Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island),[408] and Welsh in Patagonia, Argentina.[409]

Scots, a language descended from early northern Middle English, has limited recognition alongside its regional variant, Ulster Scots in Northern Ireland, without specific commitments to protection and promotion.[2][410]

It is compulsory for pupils to study a second language up to the age of 14 in England.[411] French and German are the two most commonly taught second languages in England and Scotland. All pupils in Wales are either taught Welsh as a second language up to age 16, or are taught in Welsh as a first language.[412]
